# We have criminal history - specifically arrests/convictions
# We have some number of synthetic crimes to assign
# Must be conditioned on crime type

# Find a period of time (N year window, 3 by default)
# For each year, if person was 18 or above, how many offenses of each type?

# Assign unobserved offenses, based on their criminal activity
